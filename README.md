# Rock-Paper-Scissors

## What does it do?
A simple python rock paper scissors game written in python.

## Motivation
I sometimes volunteer to teach python to newbie programmers at [Codebar](https://codebar.io/) .

This simple game is a great project for newbie programmers becasue it teaches the fundamentals of programming i.e. functions, loops and conditional statments.


## Requirements:
None - only the standard python library is utilised.
